;;
;; `executable-set-magic-mode' is a minor mode that makes a script
;; executable and sets its magic number, if any, based on the current
;; major mode. An alist of major-modes and associated script
;; interpreters is defined in `executable-set-magic-alist'.
;;
;; If variable `executable-prefix-env' is non-nil, then the magic
;; number inserted by function `executable-set-magic' takes the form
;; "#!/usr/bin/env interpreter", otherwise "#!/path/to/interpreter".
;;
;; If variable `executable-exclude-project-files' is non-nil, then
;; files contained in project directories - as defined by the function
;; `executable-project-directory' - are not processed.

;;; Installation:
;;
;;   (require 'executable-set-magic)
